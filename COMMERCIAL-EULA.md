# Commercial End User License Agreement (EULA)
for doors  
© 2025 doors dev LLC

This Commercial End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between **doors dev LLC** (“Licensor”) and the purchaser or authorized user of a paid commercial license (“Licensee”).

**Effective Date.** This Agreement is effective as of the date on which Licensee purchases a commercial license, receives a License Certificate, or otherwise assents to these terms (the “Effective Date”).

By purchasing a commercial license, accepting delivery of a License Certificate, clicking “I agree” (or similar), or deploying doors (“Software”) in production under a paid tier, Licensee acknowledges and agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

This Agreement governs Licensee’s paid commercial use of the Software and grants production-use rights beyond those available under the Business Source License 1.1 (“BUSL”) in LICENSE.txt. For non-production and Non-Commercial Use, LICENSE.txt applies. In the event of a conflict, this Agreement controls with respect to paid commercial use.

## 1. Definitions
- **Software**: doors, in source or object code, and any Updates provided under this Agreement.  
- **Production**: use to serve live or external users, or to support a live business process.  
- **Internal Use**: use by or for the benefit of Licensee’s own organization only.  
- **Client Work**: providing functionality, deliverables, or services to third parties (e.g., clients, customers, tenants).  
- **Production Domain**: one registrable DNS domain (as determined by the Public Suffix List), including all subdomains of that domain.  
- **Client Domain**: a Production Domain controlled by a third party for whom Licensee performs Client Work.  
- **Startup**: an entity meeting **all** of the following at purchase: (i) annual revenue < USD $1,000,000; (ii) incorporated < 2 years; (iii) fewer than 10 employees (FTEs).  
- **Order Form**: an ordering document (including online checkout) stating tier, licensed domain(s) or scope, and fees.  
- **License Certificate**: a machine-readable token issued by Licensor that enables Production use of the Software. A License Certificate may encode the licensed domain(s), company name, or other scope agreed in the Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form or encoded in the License Certificate, keys are permanent (no expiration).

## 2. Grant of License (Domain-Linked or Enterprise Scope)

Each paid license authorizes Production use of the Software as specified in the License Certificate and the Order Form.

### 2.1 Startup License (per Production Domain)  
Available only to a Startup. Grants Internal Use on the Production Domain(s) encoded in the License Certificate.  
**Exclusions:** no Client Work; no deployments on Client Domains.

### 2.2 Business License (per Production Domain / per Client Domain)  
For any for-profit use not qualifying as Startup. Grants Internal Use on Production Domain(s) and Client Work on Client Domain(s) encoded in the respective License Certificate(s). Each Production Domain and each Client Domain requires its own License Certificate unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.

### 2.3 Enterprise License  
For large organizations or negotiated use cases. The scope of rights (e.g., enterprise-wide, multiple domains, or company-wide entitlement) is defined in the Order Form and encoded in the License Certificate. Enterprise keys may identify the Licensee by company name or other agreed identifier rather than by domain.

**Certificate sharing.** License Certificates may be shared or redistributed; the Software will activate only for the scope encoded in the key. Use beyond the encoded scope is unlicensed use and a material breach.

---

## 3. Scope and Restrictions
(a) Licensee may copy and modify source code as reasonably necessary to exercise the rights granted.  
(b) No sublicensing, resale, or providing the Software as a stand-alone product to third parties, except to contractors acting solely on Licensee’s behalf under written confidentiality obligations.  
(c) Do not remove or alter proprietary notices.  
(d) No use beyond the scope encoded in the License Certificate or specified in the Order Form.

---

## 4. Delivery and Activation

Licensor will issue a License Certificate following payment or execution of an Order Form. 
Each License Certificate enables Production use as specified in the certificate and the Order Form. 
Unless otherwise stated, License Certificates are permanent and do not expire.

For Startup and Business tiers, certificates are domain-linked.  
For Enterprise, certificates may be domain-linked, company-linked, or enterprise-wide.  

Licensee must provide the License Certificate to the Software through the corresponding API or configuration mechanism described in Licensor’s documentation. Failure to provide a valid License Certificate, or use beyond the scope encoded in the certificate, constitutes unlicensed use and a material breach of this Agreement.

Licensor may request reasonable domain or company verification to confirm entitlement.


---

## 5. Fees and Taxes
Fees are stated in the Order Form or checkout page and are non-refundable except as required by law or expressly stated. Fees exclude applicable taxes; Licensee is responsible for taxes (excluding taxes on Licensor’s income).

---

## 6. Updates, New Versions, and Community Support
(a) **Included Rights.** License Certificates include the right to use any Updates, enhancements, and new major versions of the Software that Licensor elects to make available after purchase, at no additional charge.  
(b) **No Obligation.** Licensor is under no obligation to develop, release, or provide Updates.  
(c) **Community Support.** Licensor may provide community support via public GitHub issues or forums, at its discretion, without commitments on response time or resolution.  
(d) **No Formal Support.** No support services or SLAs are provided under this Agreement unless expressly set out in an Order Form or separate written agreement.

---

## 7. Verification and Upgrade Path

For the Startup License, Licensor may request reasonable information at the time of purchase to confirm eligibility (e.g., revenue, age of incorporation, employee count).  

After the initial verification, Licensee is not subject to ongoing audits or mandatory true-up. If Licensee’s business later grows beyond the Startup criteria, continued use of the Startup License is permitted; however, Licensee is encouraged, in good faith, to upgrade to a Business or Enterprise License to reflect its current status.

---

## 8. Confidentiality
Each party may receive non-public information marked as confidential or that should reasonably be considered confidential. The receiving party will protect such information with at least reasonable care and use it only to perform this Agreement. Exceptions include information that is public, already known without restriction, independently developed, or rightfully received from a third party.

## 9. Intellectual Property; Feedback
Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software. No rights are granted except as expressly stated. Licensor may freely use feedback without obligation.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. EXCEPT FOR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, CONFIDENTIALITY BREACHES, OR UNLICENSED USE, EACH PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE SOFTWARE.

---

## 12. Term and Termination
This Agreement continues perpetually with respect to the licenses granted, subject to termination for material breach. Either party may terminate for material breach not cured within 30 days of written notice. Upon termination, Licensee must cease Production use beyond the scope of any valid License Certificate.
