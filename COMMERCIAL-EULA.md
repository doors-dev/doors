# Commercial End User License Agreement (EULA)
for doors  
© 2025 doors dev LLC

This Commercial End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into by and between **doors dev LLC** (“Licensor”) and the purchaser or authorized user of a paid commercial license (“Licensee”).

**Effective Date.** This Agreement is effective as of the date on which Licensee purchases a commercial license, receives a License Key, or otherwise assents to these terms (the “Effective Date”).

By purchasing a commercial license, accepting delivery of a License Key, clicking “I agree” (or similar), or deploying doors (“Software”) in production under a paid tier, Licensee acknowledges and agrees to be bound by this Agreement.

This Agreement governs Licensee’s paid commercial use of the Software and grants production-use rights beyond those available under the Business Source License 1.1 (“BUSL”) in LICENSE.txt. For non-production and Non-Commercial Use, LICENSE.txt applies. In the event of a conflict, this Agreement controls with respect to paid commercial use.

## 1. Definitions
- **Software**: doors, in source or object code, and any Updates provided under this Agreement.  
- **Production**: use to serve live or external users, or to support a live business process.  
- **Internal Use**: use by or for the benefit of Licensee’s own organization only.  
- **Client Work**: providing functionality, deliverables, or services to third parties (e.g., clients, customers, tenants).  
- **Production Domain**: one registrable DNS domain (as determined by the Public Suffix List), including all subdomains of that domain.  
- **Client Domain**: a Production Domain controlled by a third party for whom Licensee performs Client Work.  
- **Startup**: an entity meeting **all** of the following at purchase: (i) annual revenue < USD $1,000,000; (ii) incorporated < 2 years; (iii) fewer than 10 employees (FTEs).  
- **Order Form**: an ordering document (including online checkout) stating tier, licensed domain(s) or scope, and fees.  
- **License Key**: a machine-readable token issued by Licensor that enables Production use of the Software. A License Key may encode the licensed domain(s), company name, or other scope agreed in the Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form or encoded in the License Key, keys are permanent (no expiration).

## 2. Grant of License (Domain-Linked or Enterprise Scope)

Each paid license authorizes Production use of the Software as specified in the License Key and the Order Form.

### 2.1 Startup License (per Production Domain)  
Available only to a Startup. Grants Internal Use on the Production Domain(s) encoded in the License Key.  
**Exclusions:** no Client Work; no deployments on Client Domains.

### 2.2 Business License (per Production Domain / per Client Domain)  
For any for-profit use not qualifying as Startup. Grants Internal Use on Production Domain(s) and Client Work on Client Domain(s) encoded in the respective License Key(s). Each Production Domain and each Client Domain requires its own License Key unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.

### 2.3 Enterprise License  
For large organizations or negotiated use cases. The scope of rights (e.g., enterprise-wide, multiple domains, or company-wide entitlement) is defined in the Order Form and encoded in the License Key. Enterprise keys may identify the Licensee by company name or other agreed identifier rather than by domain.

**Key sharing.** License Keys may be shared or redistributed; the Software will activate only for the scope encoded in the key. Use beyond the encoded scope is unlicensed use and a material breach.

---

## 3. Scope and Restrictions
(a) Licensee may copy and modify source code as reasonably necessary to exercise the rights granted.  
(b) No sublicensing, resale, or providing the Software as a stand-alone product to third parties, except to contractors acting solely on Licensee’s behalf under written confidentiality obligations.  
(c) Do not remove or alter proprietary notices.  
(d) No use beyond the scope encoded in the License Key or specified in the Order Form.

---

## 4. Delivery and Activation
Licensor will issue a License Key following payment or execution of an Order Form. Each License Key enables Production use as specified in the key and the Order Form. Unless otherwise stated, License Keys are permanent and do not expire.  

For Startup and Business tiers, keys are domain-linked.  
For Enterprise, keys may be domain-linked, company-linked, or enterprise-wide.  

Licensor may request reasonable domain or company verification to confirm entitlement. Use of the Software on unlicensed domains or beyond the key’s scope constitutes unlicensed use.

---

## 5. Fees and Taxes
Fees are stated in the Order Form or checkout page and are non-refundable except as required by law or expressly stated. Fees exclude applicable taxes; Licensee is responsible for taxes (excluding taxes on Licensor’s income).

## 7. Verification and True-Up
Startup Licensees shall, upon reasonable request, self-certify ongoing eligibility.

If under-licensing is discovered, Licensee will promptly procure the appropriate license(s).

The receiving party will protect such information with at least reasonable care and use it only to perform this Agreement.
