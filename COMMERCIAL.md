COMMERCIAL LICENSING (NON-BINDING SUMMARY)

doors is available under a dual license:
  • AGPL-3.0-only (see LICENSE), or
  • a paid Commercial License from doors dev LLC.

If you cannot comply with the AGPL (for example, you want closed-source / proprietary use),
you need a Commercial License.

Commercial licenses are issued via an Order Form and a separate commercial agreement.
This file is informational only; the signed commercial agreement controls.
