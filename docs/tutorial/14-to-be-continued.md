# To Be Continued

By this point, you have learned 80% of the stuff you need to know.  I recommend that you at least briefly go through the [Docs](../docs/01-core-concepts.md)  section to get a general understanding of:

* routing/serving capabilities
* JavaScript integration and front-end error handling
* configuration options

**Thanks!**
